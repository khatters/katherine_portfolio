                    <h1>Writing, and What it Brings to the Table</h1>
                    <p class="bodytext"> As an English major I'm often asked, 'What are you going to do with that?' In the age of STEM and AI, it's a fair question, especially as I also study UX, a seemingly unrelated field. I believe, however, that English is an inexhaustable, infinitely useful skill. <br> <br>
                    While my UX and Information Science classes have given me the building blocks for coding, UX design, and research; my English classes taught me how to think. Crafting 30-page argumentative essays, 75-page creative fiction papers, and combing through dense literature has given me both a creative and analytical mind, and when it comes to data analysis, creative strategy, and brand marketing, it's my English skills that I rely on first. <br> <br> 
                    English is also an amazing creative outlet, and one that I can use to connect with others. At Hallmark, I helped announce the launch of the summer intern cohort by writing an article circulated through the entire company. At the University of Michigan Museum of Art, I brought Ann Arbor community members together through press releases publicizing new exhibitions. <br> <br> 
                    Writing is an amazing skill - check out how I've used it below! </p>

                <b>Role:</b> Digital Merchandising and UX Intern for Hallmark.com <br> <br>
                <b>Overview:</b> Hallmark.com is the primary eCommerce platform for Hallmark Cards Inc., a lifestyle company producing cards, gift wrap, party supplies, and a wide range of gift products. <br> <br>
                <b>Problem:</b> Hallmark.com has long struggled with the best way to present its wide swath of product offerings - users often rely on the navigation menu to determine what products are available on the site, however, the language in the navigation taxonomy was confusing and ineffective as a product representation tool. <br> <br>
                <b>Where Writing Came In:</b> To address navigation taxonomy and on-site langauge confusion, I worked with UX Writing and Research colleagues to ideate new language that was ultimately implemented in Hallmark.com's new navigation taxonomy. Focusing on ease of usage and the most logical organization of product, I reformatted of several product categories, assisted with in-depth user testing of product naming, and participated in fruitful research regarding on-site language and how our competitors name their products and product categories.<br> <br>
                <b>Outcome:</b> A/B testing with the new navigation taxonomy and on-site language will launch on Hallmark.com before Q4. <br> <br>
                </p>

                    <b>Role:</b> Marketing & Web Content Asisstant for UMMA <br> <br>
                    <b>Overview:</b> As a Marketing & Web Content Assistant, I assisted the launch of UMMA's rebrand in January of 2024, including its fully rebranded website. Much of my time was directed towards moving content and assets from the old site to the new site, specifically focusing on exhibition press releases and the digitized version of UMMA's art collection. <br> <br>
                    <b>Where Writing Came In:</b> Throughout my time at UMMA, I assisted in the brainstorming and ultimate approval of the museum's new slogan as well as its new brand identity. This rebrand thus needed to be fully embodied by all copy on the website, and I assisted in both the writing and reworking of over forty UMMA webpages, ranging from event annoucements and acquisition updates to exhibit unveilings and artist introductions. <br> <br>
                    <b>Outcome:</b> 100% of old exhibition content, ranging from 2010-2024, has been successfully transferred to the new site, with copy and design updated to match UMMA's rebrand. UMMA's on-campus recognition has grown notably, with an increase in student interaction with the museum as well as the digital collection. Students have expressed excitement around the museum's rebrand, particularly its new logo, slogan, and youthful brand identity. <br> <br>

            <div class="flex-containter bodygrid"> 
                <p class = "flex-1">  
                    <b>Role:</b> Senior Marketing Strategy & Content Writer Intern <br> <br>
                    <b>Overview:</b> StudyFind is a health sciences startup focusing on connnecting research labs to research participants. StudyFind collects and maintains a wide database of research volunteers, providing them with tailored, monthly updates about researh studies they can participate in as well as research breakthroughs in their region. StudyFind serves the entire US region, with target research areas in New York, Texas, and California. <br> <br>
                    <b>Problem:</b> As a startup relying on participant registration, much of StudyFind's goals were focused on participant recruitment and the expansion of the research participant database. From January to September of 2023, I launched and oversaw the creation of StudyFind's regional newsletters, distributed to New York, Texas, and California respectively. These newsletters, alongside StudyFind's paid advertising on Google and Meta Ads, were the key recruitment and retention touchpoints for research participants. <br> <br>
                    <b>Where Writing Came In: </b> My co-management of all social and digital media marketing creation and output saw much writing, especially with the releases of our biweekly newsletters. I wrote 50% of the general audience newsletter content (1000+ recipients) and oversaw the creation of the other 50%. Our newsletter for StudyFind investors (100+ recipients) was written entirely by me, with the content then appproved by my manager before release. <br> <br> Additionally, I analyzed all social media content interactions and engagement for 2023, presenting my findings and recommendations to the CEO and StudyFind advisory board. Using skills honed in my English classes, I drafted a 20-page, comprehensive data analysis report of 2022 Google and Meta ad performance.
                    My report was received positively by the CEO, and I was later selected to co-author a professional brief detailing StudyFindâ€™s goals to improve DEI in STEM fields. This brief was released to StudyFind investors as well as to the general public. 
                    <br> <br>
                    <b>Outcome:</b> Over the course of my time as a marketing strategist at StudyFind, StudyFind's social media interaction increased by 35%, and our newsletter enrollment increased by 41%. We also saw a sharp jump in newsletter share-outs, meaning that our recipients were forwarding newsletter content to individuals not yet in our research database.  <br> <br>

                    <b>Overview:</b> Creative writing is not just something I do for school - it's a hobby that I love. I have been an avid reader and storyteller since elementary school, and I can't imagine a world in which I'm not writing for fun. <br> <br>
                    <b>Accomplishments:</b> 
                    <ul> 
                        <li class = "bulletblock"> I have self-published 7 full-length novels - my favorite genre to write is historical fantasy and science fiction. </li>
                        <li class = "bulletblock"> I have self-published two short story collections - one, "This is How I Remember It," was the 2024 winner of the University of Michigan Hopwood Undergraduate Fiction prize. </li>
                        <li class = "bulletblock"> My most recent novel work was accepted into the University of Michigan Creative English Capstone program - 10-15 students are selected to complete the capstone thesis annually. Revision runs through the 2024-2025 school year, with completion of the thesis in May! </li>
                    </ul> 
                    <br>
                    <b>Writing Process:</b> I love writing historical fantasy and science fiction - however, to make my work somewhat grounded in the real world, I have to do a lot of research. For my capstone project, which takes place in an Uzbekistan 145 years in the future, I've begun by looking at Uzbekistan's past, focusing on Uzbek culture's place in global trade, language and cultural exchange, and politics. <br> <br>
                    One of my favorite parts of the writing 'research' process is reading other people's books. A current sci-fi favorite of mine is Liu Cixin's 'The Three Body Problem' - if you're a fan of sci-fi, I highly recommend! 
                    <!-- <b>Fun UX Extra:</b> For my SI 339: Web Design, Development, & Accessibility class, I created a website for one of my historical fantasy novels! <br> <br>
