                <b>Role:</b> Digital Merchandising and UX Intern for Hallmark.com <br> <br>
                <b>Overview:</b> Hallmark.com is the primary eCommerce platform for Hallmark Cards Inc., a lifestyle company producing cards, gift wrap, party supplies, and a wide range of gift products. <br> <br>
                <b>Problem:</b> In early 2024, Hallmark.com launched a new site. However, we saw issues with meeting user journey expectations and the site's main navigation failing to support product understanding and discovery. <br> <br>
                <b>Design Process:</b> To tackle this problem, I worked with the UX team to identify user journey patterns (such as shopping first by holiday/occasion, then card recipient, then card format) as well as common roadblocks and navigation misunderstandings (e.g. personalized card vs. 'sign & send' card). Then, I created prototypes that simplified and matched the average user journey. <br> <br>
                <b>Outcome:</b> My prototypes passed user testing, and A/B tests on-site will launch before 2024 Q4. <br> <br>
                <b>Skills Used:</b> User Testing, User Research, Data Analytics, Persona Creation & Ideation, UX Writing, Prototyping, Wireframing, Figma <br> <br>

                    <b>Role:</b> UX Team Member for Hallmark Intern Group Project <br> <br>
                    <b>Overview:</b> During my summer internship with Hallmark, I completed a 3-month group project with 6 interns across various departments. My role was to bring our concepts to life and connect them to Hallmark's loyalty & rewards program, Crown Rewards. <br> <br>
                    <b>Problem:</b> Our challenge was to create a Hallmark product promoting 'caring as a hobby,' engaging Hallmark's consumers while bringing in revenue. <br> <br>
                    <b>Design Process:</b> My team and I ideated and created 'Cooking Connect,' an online community where users share family recipes and create personalized digital cookbooks. Users can join tailored cooking groups, import other users' recipes to their cookbooks, interact with exclusive Hallmark Channel content, and, most importantly, earn and use Crown Rewards points. <br> <br>
                    <b>Outcome:</b> To create the most cohesive product pitch, I created a prototype of Cooking Connect highlighting its most essential features (Digital Cookbook Customization Page, Crown Rewards, Recipe Groups, Homepage), focusing on keeping the site consistent with Hallmark's brand image and style guide. I also aimed 
                    to highlight some of Hallmark's products (e.g., kitchenware, serve ware) within the layout. Ultimately, we recieved positive feedback for the way the design implemented both relevant Hallmark product and Crown Rewards. <br> <br>
                    <b>Skills Used:</b> User Testing, User Research, Data Analytics, Persona Creation & Ideation, SWOT Analysis, UX Writing, Prototyping, Wireframing, Figma, Team Building <br> <br>

                            <b>Role:</b> Marketing & Web Content Asisstant for UMMA <br> <br>
                            <b>Overview:</b> The University of Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA) is the city of Ann Arbor's main art museum and one of the largest university art museums in the US. UMMA prides itself on its unique and immersive exhibits, as well as its role as a community gathering space.  <br> <br>
                            <b>Problem:</b> UMMA's 40 foot tall exhibit 'Future Cache,' presented by artist Andrea Carlson, highlights the Cheboiganing (Burt Lake) Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Native Americans removed from their Michigan land. The exhibit is presented both in English and Anishinaabe, the Cheboiganing language. However, without a digital component, visitors were unable to hear and experience Anishinaabe. <br> <br>
                            <b>Design Process:</b> I created a prototype that simply and easily highlights how to listen to both the English and Anishinaabe featured in the exhibit, providing both dialects of Anishinaabe which were recorded by Cheboiganing elders. My design mimics that of the 40-foot wall so as not to draw the visitors out of the exhibit. <br> <br>
                            <b>Outcome:</b> My prototype was approved by the marketing office and sent to UMMA's tech partners for production. The digital experience was implemented via QR code for the duration of the exhibit (approx. 9 months). It was also made available on the UMMA website for those unable to visit the exhibit in-person. <br> <br>
                            <b>Skills Used:</b> Marketing, Prototyping, Wireframing, Figma <br> <br>

                        <b>Role:</b> UX Design Student Focusing on Accessibility <br> <br>
                        <b>Overview:</b> For my UX Design class SI 422: Needs Assessment & Usability Evaluation, my team created an app assisting mobility impaired students and faculty, making it easier for them to travel around campus, visit dining halls, and find accessible places to park. <br> <br>
                        <b>Problem:</b> Creating an app that inclusive of all mobility impairments (e.g., someone with limited finger usage), includes the most accurate and useful campus data, and can be used in-tandem with a fully-abled person (i.e., if a mobility-impaired student is traveling with an able-bodied friend).<br> <br>
                        <b>Design Process:</b> To create the app prototype, I worked with team members to interviewed mobility-impaired students on campus and researched key digital needs for mobility-impaired users. I also worked to make the app fully integrated with existing UofM applications, adhering to UofM style and usability guidelines. <br> <br>
                        <b>Outcome:</b> Our team successfully presented our final project and recieved an A for our concept, research, and app design. <br> <br>

                                <b>Role:</b> MProduct Club Member: Product Design <br> <br>
                                <b>Overview:</b> MProduct is an application-based University of Michigan student organization that supports students interested in product development, product management, and product design. <br> <br>
                                <b>Problem:</b> The University of Michigan is surrounded by thousands and thousands of restaurants and cafes, however, students often struggle to find new restaurants within their budget. My team created an app that helps UofM students explore new restaurants based on price, location, cusine, and relative student ranking. <br> <br>
                                <b>Design Process:</b> While creating our app prototype, I collaborated with team members to interview students, analyze student needs, and do competative research on other social media platforms and food-finding sites. I aimed to create a fun and lively app experience, vaguely linking it to the University of Michigan brand without creating explicit assocation.  <br> <br>
                                <b>Outcome:</b> Our team successfully pitched our project to the wider MProduct organization; our project was approved to move to the next stage of production. <br> <br>
