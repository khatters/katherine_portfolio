                <b>Role:</b> UX Team Member for Hallmark Intern Group Project <br> <br>
                <b>Overview:</b> I completed a 3-month group project with 6 interns across various departments to create a Hallmark product that would 'promote caring as a hobby,' engaging consumers while bringing revenue to the business.  <br> <br>
                <b>Problem:</b> Our product, 'Cooking Connect,' is an online cooking community connecting users with family and friends to share treasured recipes and make personalized digital cookbooks. Since Cooking Connect isn't directly revenue based, we aimed to build consumer loyalty, pushing users towards Crown Rewards to ultimately increase purchase behavior on Hallmark.com. <br> <br>
                <b>Design Process:</b> I began with competative analysis, analyzing UX loyalty testing of Starbucks, Michael's, Sephora, Kohl's, and Chipotle's rewards programs and conducted internal research, identifying Crown Rewards complaints and suggestions from current consumers. I opted to build ways for users to earn and redeem points through cooking mini games and recipe competitions, as well as the ability to purchase special recipes and Hallmark Channel exclusive content via points. <br> <br>
                <b> Outcome: </b> My team sucessfully pitched our idea to Hallmark leadership, recieving accolades for our unique integration of Crown Rewards. <br> <br>
                <b> Skills Used:</b> Loyalty Research, Loyalty & Rewards Testing, Competative Research & Analysis, User Testing, User Research, Data Analytics, Persona Creation & Ideation, UX Writing, Prototyping, Wireframing, Figma <br> <br>

                            <b> Role:</b> Digital Merchandising and UX Intern for Hallmark.com <br> <br>
                            <b> Overview: </b> During my time at Hallmark I've assisted the XD team in consumer joruney research, focusing heavily on how to meet the consumer where they are and assist them in sorting through Hallmark's uniquely large variety of product sets. <br> <br>
                            <b> Problem:</b> Hallmark.com is home to almost all of your party, gifting, and card needs - however, this can make traversing the site (and identifying the breadth of product) quite difficult. My goal was to ideate new search & navigation attributes that could make this journey simpler. <br> <br>
                            <b> Design & Research Process:</b> I began with user research and competative analysis, studying comparable eCommerce platforms like Walmart, Amazon, Target, and Etsy. I identified key user complaints via Hallmark's Medallia data and always-on site surveys, supporting my conclusions with site traffic data from ContentSquare. <br> <br>
                            <b>Outcome:</b> Ultimately, I created a prototype of a 'Gifting Guide' that simplifies the gifting search process as requested by many of Hallmark.com's frequent and first-time shoppers. The Gift Guide will be user tested in Q1 of 2025. <br> <br>
                            <b>Skills Used:</b> User Research, Data Analysis, Wireframing, Consumer Journey Research, Figma, Prototyping. <br> <br>

                        <b>Role:</b> UX Design Student Focusing on Accessibility <br> <br>
                        <b>Overview:</b> For my UX Design class SI 422: Needs Assessment & Usability Evaluation, my team created MWheel, an app assisting mobility impaired students and faculty. <br> <br>
                        <b>Problem:</b> Creating an app that inclusive of all mobility impairments, includes the most accurate and useful campus data, and can be used in-tandem with a fully-abled person (i.e., if a mobility-impaired student is traveling with able-bodied friends).<br> <br>
                        <b>Design & Research Process:</b> In order to understand the needs of the user, I participated heavily in the user interviewing and research process. This helped me to create user personas like Brian, a second-year Computer Science student with cerebral palsy. I mapped out how Brian might move through the app, and how he could customize its services to his specific needs. <br> <br>
                        <b>Outcome:</b> My design strove to keep all mobility impairments in mind, like creating large buttons and keeping the flow of app pages simple and concise. MWheel is intended to speed up travel, so ideally, users like Brian would spend as little time on-app as possible. <br> <br>
                        <b>Skills Used:</b> Persona Creation and Ideation, User Interviewing, User Research, Prototyping, Wireframing, Figma <br> <br>
