                        <b>Overview:</b> During the summer of 2024, I worked cross-departmentally with the UX & Digital Merchandising teams to identify how allied and licensed products should appear and be promoted on Hallmark.com. Given Hallmark’s wide swath of product offerings, Hallmark must always balance presentation of non-Hallmark branded products with Hallmark-branded ones.  <br> <br> 
                        <b>Strategic Work:</b> Alongside UX testing that ascertained consumer perception of Hallmark’s brand, I did competitive research to identify how brands like Paper Source and Rifle Paper Co. balance allied and owned products. My recommendations, which included improving Hallmark’s digital guided shopping experience, elevating mixed-product categories like ‘Home Décor’ and ‘Pop Culture,’ and reorganizing navigation taxonomy to reflect consumers’ varied shopping patterns, aimed to increase consumer trust, nostalgia for, and recognition of Hallmark, integrating allied and owned products on-site while also highlighting the Hallmark brand. <br><br>
                        <b>Outcome:</b> Hallmark’s navigation taxonomy will undergo live on-site A/B testing before Q4 of 2024, with testing of a ‘Hallmark Gifting Guide’ digital assistant launching in Q1 of 2025.

                    <p class="bodytext">
                        <b>Overview:</b> In May 2023, UMMA began its comprehensive rebrand, working with an ad agency partner to identify new brand colors, logo options, slogans, and brand voices. <br> <br> 
                        <b>Strategic Work:</b> I assisted heavily with creative strategy as UMMA developed its new image, acting as a liaison between the UMMA marketing office and Phire Group, our ad agency partner. I performed community research and ran branding focus groups, creating ten branding layouts to showcased new logos and branding themes. I additionally conducted social media and website audits on 25 competitor museums and cultural organizations, ensuring that UMMA’s new brand identity was fresh but also in-alignment with consumer expectations. <br><br>
                        <b>Outcome:</b> UMMA’s rebrand and new website launched successfully in January 2025, with all aspects of the rebrand received positively by the student body as well as the greater Ann Arbor community.

                        <b>Overview:</b> In Fall of 2022, StudyFind, a health sciences research startup, was looking to expand its research participant database and improve its reputation for DEI amongst other research organizations.  <br> <br> 
                        <b>Strategic Work:</b> As a Senior Marketing Strategy & Content Writer intern, I led the analysis of StudyFind’s social media content and interaction, developing a content marketing playbook. I additionally created a content posting schedule and reviewed and approved all content before go-live. In Q4 of 2022, I co-authored a professional brief detailing StudyFind’s DEI accomplishments, contributions to university research programs, and goals to improve DEI in STEM fields. I additionally led analysis of StudyFind’s 2022 paid advertising, creating a recommendation playbook for 2023’s ad expenditures.  <br><br>
                        <b>Outcome:</b> With my content marketing playbook implemented, StudyFind saw a 35% increase in social media traction in Q1 of 2023. My professional brief and paid advertising analysis was also circulated within the company, and my ad analysis was used to inform 2023 advertising.
