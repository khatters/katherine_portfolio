                <b>Role:</b> Digital Merchandising and UX Intern for Hallmark.com <br> <br>
                <b>Overview:</b> Hallmark.com is the primary eCommerce platform for Hallmark Cards Inc., a lifestyle company producing cards, gift wrap, party supplies, and a wide range of gift products. <br> <br>
                <b>Problem:</b> In early 2024, Hallmark.com launched a new site. However, we saw issues with meeting user journey expectations and the site's main navigation failing to support product understanding and discovery. <br> <br>
                <b>Design Process:</b> To tackle this problem, I worked with the UX team to identify user journey patterns (such as shopping first by holiday/occasion, then card recipient, then card format) as well as common roadblocks and navigation misunderstandings (e.g. personalized card vs. 'sign & send' card). Then, I created prototypes that simplified and matched the average user journey. <br> <br>
                <b>Outcome:</b> My prototypes passed user testing, and A/B tests on-site will launch before Q4. <br> <br>
                <b>Skills Used:</b> User Testing, User Research, Data Analytics, Persona Creation & Ideation, UX Writing, Prototyping, Wireframing, Figma <br> <br>

                    <b>Role:</b> UX Team Member for Hallmark Intern Group Project <br> <br>
                    <b>Overview:</b> During my summer internship with Hallmark, I completed a 3-month group project with 6 interns across various departments. My role was to bring our concepts to life and connect them to Hallmark's loyalty & rewards program, Crown Rewards. <br> <br>
                    <b>Problem:</b> Our challenge was to create a Hallmark product that would 'promote caring as a hobby,' engaging Hallmark's consumers while bringing in revenue for the business. <br> <br>
                    <b>Design Process:</b> My team and I ideated and created 'Cooking Connect,' an online community where users can share family recipes and create personalized digital cookbooks. Users can create and interact with recipe groups, import other users' recipes to their cookbooks, interact with exclusive Hallmark Channel Content, and, most importantly, earn and use Crown Rewards points. <br> <br>
                    <b>Outcome:</b> To create the most cohesive product pitch, I created a prototype of Cooking Connect that highlighted its most essential features (Digital Cookbook Customization Page, Crown Rewards, Recipe Groups, Homepage), focusing on keeping the site consistent with Hallmark's brand image and style guide. I also aimed 
                    to highlight some of Hallmark's products (e.g., kitchenware, paper plates, serve ware, etc.) within the layout. Ultimately, I recieved strong positive feedback for the way the design implemented both relevant Hallmark product as well as the Crown Rewards loyalty program. <br> <br>
                    <b>Skills Used:</b> User Testing, User Research, Data Analytics, Persona Creation & Ideation, SWOT Analysis, UX Writing, Prototyping, Wireframing, Figma, Team Building <br> <br>

                            <b>Role:</b> Marketing & Web Content Asisstant for UMMA <br> <br>
                            <b>Overview:</b> The University of Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA) is the city of Ann Arbor's main art museum and one of the largest university art museums in the US. UMMA prides itself on its unique and immersive exhibits, as well as its role as a community gathering space.  <br> <br>
                            <b>Problem:</b> UMMA's 40 foot tall exhibit 'Future Cache,' presented by artist Andrea Carlson, is a work that highlights Cheboiganing (Burt Lake) Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Native Americans who were removed from their land in Michigan. The exhibit is presented both in English and Anishinaabe, a native language. However, without a digital component visitors were unable to hear and experience the Anishinaabe language. <br> <br>
                            <b>Design Process:</b> To implement the digital component, I worked with the UMMA marketing office to install a QR code in the exhibit that allows users to easily access the digital experience on their phones. Then, I created a prototype that simply and easily highlighted how to listen to both the English and Anishinaabe featured in the exhibit, with the digital experience providing both dialects of Anishinaabe. My design mimics that of the 40-foot wall, so as not to draw the visitors out of the exhibit. <br> <br>
                            <b>Outcome:</b> My prototype was approved by the marketing office and sent to UMMA's tech partners for production. The digital experience was implemented for the duration of the exhibit (approx. 9 months) and made available on the UMMA website for those unable to visit the exhibit in-person. <br> <br>

                        <b>Role:</b> UX Design Student Focusing on Accessibility <br> <br>
                        <b>Overview:</b> For my UX Design class SI 422: Needs Assessment & Usability Evaluation, my team was challenged to create a product that solved a student user need. We decided to create an app that would assist mobility impaired students and faculty, making it easier for them to travel around campus, visit dining halls, and find accessible places to park. <br> <br>
                        <b>Problem:</b> Creating an app that was inclusive of all mobility impairments (e.g., someone with limited finger usage), included the most accurate and useful campus data, and could be used in-tandem with a fully-abled person (i.e., if a mobility-impaired student was traveling with an able-bodied friend).<br> <br>
                        <b>Design Process:</b> To create the app prototype, I worked with team members who interviewed mobility-impaired students on campus and researched key digital needs for mobility-impaired users. I also worked to make the app fully integrated with existing UofM applications, adhering to the style and usability guidelines. <br> <br>
                        <!-- <b>Outcome:</b> Our team successfully presented our final project and recieved an A for our concept, research, and app design. <br> <br>

                                <b>Role:</b> MProduct Club Member: Product Design <br> <br>
                                <b>Overview:</b> MProduct is an application-based University of Michigan student organization that supports students who are interested in product development, product management, and product design. Accepted students may elect to choose an area of focus and are then sorted into teams to create a product that's ultimately pitched to the wider MProduct organization.  <br> <br>
                                <b>Problem:</b> The University of Michigan is surrounded by thousands and thousands of restaurants and cafes, however, a frequent complaint on campus is the inability to find new spots that fit with an individual student's limited spending power. My team decided to create an app that helps UofM students find, rate, and explore new restaurants based on price, location, cusine, and relative student ranking. <br> <br>
                                <b>Design Process:</b> While creating our app prototype, I collaborated with team members to interview students, analyze student needs, and do competative research on other social media platforms and food-finding sites. I aimed to create a fun and lively app experience, vaguely linking it to the University of Michigan brand without creating explicit assocation.  <br> <br>
                                <b>Outcome:</b> Our team successfully pitched our project to the wider MProduct organization; our project was approved to move to the next stage of production. <br> <br>
