                <b>Role:</b> Digital Merchandising and UX Intern for Hallmark.com <br> <br>
                <b>Overview:</b> Hallmark.com is the primary eCommerce platform for Hallmark Cards Inc., a lifestyle company producing cards, gift wrap, party supplies, and a wide range of gift products. <br> <br>
                <b>Problem:</b> In early 2024, Hallmark.com launched a new site. However, we saw issues with meeting user journey expectations and the site's main navigation failing to support product understanding and discovery. <br> <br>
                <b>Research Process:</b> To begin identifying the ideal user journey on Hallmark.com, I did a deep-dive into the user: combing through previous and present user personas, Hallmark.com purchasing statistics, on-site traffic data, 
                and analyzing eCommerce competitors like American Greetings, Walmart, Target, and Shutterfly. I organized my findings, creating user testing tasks based on my predictions and set up 2 rounds of on-site user testing with 2 groups of 15 users, ranging from ages 18-71. My tasks focused on finding a wide range of Hallmark products, from Birthday and Sympathy Cards to licensed gifts products like Peanuts stuffed animals. <br> <br>
                <b>Outcome:</b> Through testing, I was able to successfully identify user journey roadblocks on Hallmark.com. This then allowed me to move to the next phase of research: identifying a new optimal navigation path. <br> <br>

                    <b>Overview:</b> After identifying key user journey roadblocks and navigation menu issues, my next steps were to create new navigation taxonomy that would match users' preferred journey paths and help users identify what products are sold on Hallmark.com. <br> <br>
                    <b>Research Process:</b> Based on my findings from previous research and user testing experiments, I created four new navigation taxonomies and ran five rounds of user testing with the tree test method, gradually iterating on each taxonomy option based on test results. Ultimately, in partnership with my UX Research colleague, we ran tests with about 65 individuals ranging from ages 18-71, identifying the most successful navigation taxonomy option. <br> <br>
                    <b>Outcome:</b> The most optimal navigation taxonomy has been finalized, and Hallmark will run A/B tests on-site with the new navigation menu and our current navigation menu before Q4. If the new navigation is successful in reducing site exit and increasing conversion, it will be implemented in advance of the winter holiday season.  <br> <br>

                            <b>Role:</b> UX Design Student Focusing on Accessibility <br> <br>
                            <b>Overview:</b> For my UX Design class SI 422: Needs Assessment & Usability Evaluation, my team was challenged to create a product that solved a student user need. We decided to create an app that would assist mobility impaired students and faculty, making it easier for them to travel around campus, visit dining halls, and find accessible places to park. <br> <br>
                            <b>Problem:</b> Creating an app that was inclusive of all mobility impairments (e.g., someone with limited finger usage), included the most accurate and useful campus data, and could be used in-tandem with a fully-abled person (i.e., if a mobility-impaired student was traveling with an able-bodied friend).<br> <br>
                            <b>Research Process:</b> To begin work on the design of the app, it was essential that I familiarize myself with the features necessary for an individual with limited mobility. I also needed to be expert in how the data provided to the user would be pulled and stored to ensure a smooth user experience (e.g., Where does the parking data come from? How can we trouble shoot for scenarios where there's no data available?). 
                            To address mobility needs, I worked closely with my teammates to assist heavily in the user interviewing process, as well as researching both ADA and WCAG guidelines to ensure the app was fully usable for all. I also did research on cloud storage, as well as competative research on other Ann Arbor area apps to identify how they pull and store public data, and what features could be implemented in our app.
                            First understanding the data requirements behind each feature on the app laid the groundwork for my initial wireframes, and was ultimately essential in creating my final prototype of the product. <br> <br>
                            <b>Outcome:</b> Our team successfully presented our final project and recieved an A for our concept, research, and app design. <br> <br>
