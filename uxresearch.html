                <b>Role:</b> Digital Merchandising and UX Intern for Hallmark.com <br> <br>
                <b>Overview:</b> Hallmark.com is the primary eCommerce platform for Hallmark Cards Inc., a lifestyle company producing cards, gift wrap, party supplies, and a wide range of gift products. <br> <br>
                <b>Problem:</b> In early 2024, Hallmark.com launched a new site. However, we saw issues with meeting user journey expectations and the site's main navigation failing to support product understanding and discovery. <br> <br>
                <b>Research Process:</b> To begin identifying the ideal user journey on Hallmark.com, I did a deep-dive into the user, combing through previous and present user personas, Hallmark.com purchasing statistics, on-site traffic data, 
                and analyzing eCommerce competitors like American Greetings, Walmart, Target, and Shutterfly. I organized my findings, creating user testing tasks based on my predictions and set up 2 rounds of on-site user testing with users ranging from ages 18-71. Users were tasked with finding a wide range of Hallmark products, from Birthday and Sympathy Cards to licensed gifts products like Peanuts stuffed animals. <br> <br>
                <b>Outcome:</b> Through testing, I was able to successfully identify user journey roadblocks on Hallmark.com. This then allowed me to move to the next phase of research: identifying a new optimal navigation path. <br> <br>
                <b>Duration:</b> 2 months (ongoing) <br> <br>
                <b>Tools:</b> ContentSquare, Tableau, Adobe Analytics, User Persona Research & Ideation, User Testing <br> <br>

                    <b>Role:</b> Digital Merchandising and UX Intern for Hallmark.com <br> <br>
                    <b>Overview:</b> After identifying key user journey roadblocks and navigation menu issues, my next steps were to create new navigation taxonomy that would match users' preferred journey paths and help users identify what products are sold on Hallmark.com. <br> <br>
                    <b>Research Process:</b> Based on findings from previous research and user testing, I created four new navigation taxonomies and ran five rounds of user testing with the tree test method, gradually iterating on each taxonomy option based on results. Ultimately, in partnership with my UX Research colleague, we ran tests with about 65 individuals ranging from ages 18-71, identifying the most successful navigation taxonomy option. <br> <br>
                    <b>Outcome:</b> A/B testing with the new navigation taxonomy will go live on Hallmark.com before 2024 Q4. If the new navigation is successful in reducing site exit and increasing conversion, it will be implemented in advance of the winter holiday season. <br> <br>

                            <b>Role:</b> UX Design Student Focusing on Accessibility <br> <br>
                            <b>Overview:</b> For my UX Design class SI 422: Needs Assessment & Usability Evaluation, my team created an app assisting mobility impaired students and faculty, making it easier for them to travel around campus, visit dining halls, and find accessible places to park. <br> <br>
                            <b>Research Process:</b> To understand the app's user, I participated heavily in the user interviewing process and researched both ADA and WCAG guidelines. I also did research on cloud storage, as well as competative research on other Ann Arbor area apps to identify how they pull and store public data.
                            Understanding the user needs as well as the data requirements behind each feature on the app laid the groundwork for my initial wireframes, and were ultimately essential in creating my final prototype of the product. <br> <br>
                            <b>Outcome:</b> Our team successfully presented our final project and recieved an A for our concept, research, and app design. <br> <br>
